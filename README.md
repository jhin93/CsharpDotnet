# Enterprise Monitoring and Alert System
***
## Project Overview

This centralized platform is engineered to monitor and analyze the performance, status, and logs of multiple applications and services. It delivers real-time alerts, customizable dashboards, and robust event processing capabilities, serving as a critical tool for effective system management.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Metrics Collection and Analysis**: Monitors application and server performance metrics in real time.
- **Log Management**: Collects, normalizes, and stores logs for streamlined analysis.
- **Threshold-based Alert System**: Triggers alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- **Multi-channel Integration**: Supports notifications via email, SMS, Slack, and other channels.
- **User-customizable Dashboards**: Enables tailored visualization of system data.
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Supports multiple users or organizations within a single instance.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures secure access with defined user roles.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3**: Powers FastAPI and Django-based API services for efficient data handling.
- **.NET/C#**: Drives alert processing and authentication services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Serves as the primary database for metadata and time-series data storage.
- **Redis**: Facilitates caching and real-time data processing.

### Frontend
- **React**: Provides dynamic dashboard UI components.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Handles client-side logic.
- **npm**: Manages frontend package dependencies.

### DevOps
- **Docker**: Enables service containerization for consistent deployment.
- **AWS**: Leverages cloud infrastructure (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, S3) for scalability.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD pipelines for streamlined development workflows.

## System Components

### Backend Services
- **Data Collection API**: Built with Python 3 and FastAPI for efficient data ingestion.
- **Alert and Event Processing**: Implemented in .NET/C# for robust alert handling.
- **Dashboard API**: Developed with Python 3 and Django for seamless dashboard data delivery.
- **Authentication/Authorization Service**: Utilizes .NET/C# to enforce secure access control.

### Data Stores
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores metadata and time-series data for reliable persistence.
- **Redis**: Supports real-time caching and task queue management.

### Deployment Environment
- **AWS EKS-based Kubernetes Cluster**: Hosts containerized microservices.
- **Containerized Microservices Architecture**: Ensures modularity and scalability.
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Facilitates continuous integration and deployment.
