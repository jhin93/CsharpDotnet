- **AWS**: Leverages cloud infrastructure (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, S3) and CI/CD (CodePipeline) for scalability and automation.
- **Git**: Manages version control, integrated with CI/CD pipelines.

## System Components

### Backend Services
- **Data Collection API**: Built with Python 3 and FastAPI for efficient data ingestion.
- **Alert and Event Processing**: Implemented with Python 3 to handle alert triggers and event processing.
- **Dashboard API**: Developed with Python 3 and FastAPI for seamless data delivery to visualization tools.
- **Authentication/Authorization Service**: Utilizes Python 3 with JWT-based authentication to enforce secure access control.

### Data Stores
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores metadata and time-series data for reliable persistence.
- **Redis**: Supports real-time caching and task queue management.

### Deployment Environment
- **AWS EKS-based Kubernetes Cluster**: Hosts containerized microservices for modularity and scalability.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Manages CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment to the EKS cluster.
- **Containerized Microservices Architecture**: Ensures flexibility and ease of scaling.

## CI/CD Pipeline Details

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using **AWS CodePipeline**, integrated with AWS services to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The pipeline is structured as follows:

- **Source Stage**:
  - **Source**: Pulls code from a GitHub repository using AWS CodeStar Source Connection.
  - **Trigger**: Activates on code commits to the main branch.
  - **Output**: Source code artifacts stored in an S3 bucket.

- **Build Stage**:
  - **Service**: AWS CodeBuild compiles the Python FastAPI application and builds Docker images.
  - **Configuration**: Uses a `buildspec.yml` file to define build steps, including dependency installation (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and Docker image creation (`docker build -t my-app:latest .`).
  - **Output**: Docker images pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

- **Deploy Stage**:
  - **Service**: AWS CodeDeploy integrates with EKS to deploy Docker images to the Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Configuration**: Updates Kubernetes manifests (e.g., `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`) to roll out new versions with zero downtime using rolling updates.
  - **Process**: Applies manifests via `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`, managed by CodePipeline’s EKS deployment action.
  - **Validation**: Post-deployment health checks ensure service availability.

- **Monitoring**:
  - **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors pipeline execution, logs build and deployment metrics, and triggers alerts for failures.
  - **Rollback**: Configured to revert to the previous stable version in case of deployment failures.

This pipeline ensures rapid, reliable deployments with minimal manual intervention, leveraging AWS’s integrated ecosystem for efficiency and scalability.

## Development Roadmap
